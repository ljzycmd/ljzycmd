### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo, under the supervision of Prof. Yinqiang Zheng. My research focuses on computer vision and deep learning, with a particular interest in visual generative models, image/video synthesis, and editing.

Before this, I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in Control Engineering from Tsinghua University, where I worked with Prof. Yujiu Yang on image/video restoration and enhancement. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering at Central South University in 2018.
